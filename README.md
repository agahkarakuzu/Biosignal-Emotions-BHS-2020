# Project Description: BrainHack School 2020

## Summary 

Building a machine learning classifier + familiarizing myself with tools learned in the first week of the BrainHack school. Details to be determined based on whether I collaborate with others.

## Project definition 

### Background

I’m a master’s student working on the development of a device for students on the autism spectrum. The project envisions a device that can address students’ auditory sensitivities by filtering out distressing classroom sounds in real-time. I plan to use machine learning techniques for the following 2 components of the project: 

1.	Audio event classification for the detection of identified classroom sounds
2.	Biosignal-based automatic emotion recognition for the detection of sound-induced distress

Assuming that #2 is where I can make the most of the expertise of fellow BrainHack school participants, I thought I could focus on biosignal processing for automatic emotion recognition during the project weeks.

### Tools 

Tools and techniques I'm interested in familiarizing myself with:
 1.	High-performance computing: Compute Canada
 2.	1+ Python library for machine learning (e.g. PyTorch)
 3.	Biosignal pre-processing and feature extraction with Python
 4.	Data visualization with Python
 5.	GitHub
 6.	Containerization (e.g. Singularity)

### Data 

The data collection for my master’s project has been postponed due to Covid-19, so this is the perfect opportunity to play around with open data instead! Last week when I started thinking about what kind of project I’d like to do for the BrainHack school, I sent out a couple of emails requesting access to multi-modal emotion recognition databases. So far, I’ve gotten access to:

 * [The MAHNOB-HCI-Tagging database](https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/)
 * [DREAMER: A Database for Emotion Recognition through EEG and ECG Signals from Wireless Low-cost Off-the-Shelf Devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7887697)

The data that I ultimately use will presumably depend on whether I work with other participants and what data they're using. I am also considering the possibility of using larger biosignal databases for transfer learning. But this is yet to be determined.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, I plan to have:
 - A classifier trained using Compute Canada.
