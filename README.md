## Summary 

Biosignal processing for automatic emotion recognition using open data.

## Project definition 

### Background

Danielle:

 I’m a master’s student working on the development of a device for students on the autism spectrum. The project envisions a device that can address students’ auditory sensitivities by filtering out distressing classroom sounds in real-time. I plan to use machine learning techniques for the following 2 components of the project: 

 1.	Audio event classification for the detection of identified classroom sounds
 2.	Biosignal-based automatic emotion recognition for the detection of sound-induced distress

 Assuming that #2 is where I can make the most of the expertise of fellow BrainHack school participants, I thought I could focus on biosignal processing for automatic emotion recognition during the project weeks.
 
 Achraf :
 
I am currently studying Biomedical Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal (M.Eng) and am enrolled in the Brain Hack School 2020 adventure for growing my technical skills as well as networking. I have been modestly introduced to NeuroImaging before enrolling in the biomedical engineering path and would like to broaden my knowledge of the field and sharpen my skills in it.

My goal through the Brain Hack School 2020 is to learn as much as I can about modern ways of doing NeuroImaging, to improve my python skills through a hands-on multi-disciplinary project, and to exchange information and expertise with the other participants.

The project idea is from Danielle Benesch with whom I will be collaborating.

### Tools 

Tools and techniques we plan to use:
 1.	High-performance computing: Compute Canada
 2.	Preprocessing and feature extraction with Python
 3.	Data visualization with Python
 4.	GitHub
 5.	Python Virtual Environment

### Data 

So far, we have access to the following multi-modal emotion recognition databases: 

 - [The MAHNOB-HCI-Tagging database](https://mahnob-db.eu/hci-tagging/)
 - [DREAMER: A Database for Emotion Recognition through EEG and ECG Signals from Wireless Low-cost Off-the-Shelf Devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7887697)

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, we plan to complete:
 - Data preprocessing and feature extraction using Compute Canada.
